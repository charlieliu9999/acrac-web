Masses (fibroadenomas) that are assessed as probably benign (BI-RADS 3) warrant US follow-up to assess for progression [28].","超声可评估可触及的肿块[2,7]，适用于对可能良性肿块的持续监测。被评估为可能良性（BI-RADS 3类）的肿块（如纤维腺瘤）需通过超声随访以评估进展情况[28]。",False,Usually appropriate,通常适宜,LimitedReferences,O 0 mSv,O 0 mSv [ped],9,9.0

Scatter radiation to the fetus is negligible [2]. Tomosynthesis with mammography may provide added benefit of detection in denser breast tissue of pregnancy [3,8,23]. It may be a useful adjunct to US findings, especially if US findings are suspicious. Mammography may reveal suspicious calcifications.","妊娠期乳腺X线摄影被认为是安全的。胎儿受到的散射辐射可忽略不计[2]。乳腺X线断层合成技术可为妊娠期致密乳腺组织的检测提供额外优势[3,8,23]。该技术可作为超声检查的有益补充，尤其当超声结果可疑时。乳腺X线摄影可检出可疑钙化灶。",False,Usually appropriate,通常适宜,LimitedReferences,☢☢  0.1-1mSv,,9,9.0
